# MeArm-Tower-of-Hanoi
A rapid prototyping robotic solution to the Tower of Hanoi Problem using primarily:
  1) Arduino Uno with 4 microservos
  2) MeArm laser cut from MDF
  3) Processing for visualization and GUI
  
See the REPORT.pdf for diagrams and explanations, or

for a short presentation of the features.

The arduinoLogic.ino is most of the backend, the gameScreen.zip contains the files of the Processing-based GUI.
